The Endpoint-Javascript-Explorer is a powerful JavaScript bookmarklet designed for discovering and analyzing endpoints embedded in JavaScript files across various domains. By entering specific scopes or leaving the field blank to search all domains, users can extract and examine URLs from JavaScript documents found on web pages.

Key Features:

- Scope Filtering: Search within specified domains or all available domains.
- Comprehensive Parsing: Extract both relative and absolute URLs from JavaScript files and the current web page.
- Interactive Table: View results in a sortable, filterable table that includes the source JavaScript file, URL, file extension, and a link to open the file.
- Custom Actions: Copy URLs to clipboard or save the results as an HTML file for offline analysis.
- User-Friendly Interface: Includes dropdown filters and action buttons to streamline the analysis process.

Ideal for developers, security analysts, and researchers who need to track and inspect endpoints in web applications.

## Hereâ€™s how to set it up:

Setting this up is straightforward: just copy the code into a JavaScript bookmark and paste it into the URL field of the bookmark.
